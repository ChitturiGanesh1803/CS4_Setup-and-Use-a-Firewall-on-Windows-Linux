1. What is a firewall?
A firewall is a security system that allows or blocks network traffic based on rules.

2. Difference between stateful and stateless firewall?

Stateless checks each packet separately.

Stateful remembers active connections and is more secure.

3. What are inbound and outbound rules?

Inbound rules control traffic coming into the system.

Outbound rules control traffic leaving the system.

4. How does UFW simplify firewall management?
UFW makes firewall configuration easy by using simple commands instead of complex rules.

5. Why block port 23 (Telnet)?
Because Telnet sends data in plain text and is insecure. SSH should be used instead.

6. What are common firewall mistakes?
Leaving unused ports open, allowing all traffic, and not monitoring firewall logs.

7. How does a firewall improve network security?
It blocks unauthorized access and reduces the attack surface.

8. What is NAT in firewalls?
NAT hides internal IP addresses and allows multiple devices to use one public IP.
